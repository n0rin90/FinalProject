Women working has been a topic for many centuries. Although, many women in the world today do have the opportunity of getting an education and an independent income, there are still many women in some parts of the world where they wonâ€™t get such an opportunity. More specifically, the region around south-Asia has a lot of potential in local labor and local talents in the fields of textile for instance. As the situation stands today, these women have limited options in regards to how to use their potential and this is the problem our team at ComShare wants to solve and put a spotlight on.
Women in some parts of the world are either denied their own independent income or they become labors for big companies such as H&M. If they do become labors for big companies, the salary is pretty low and the work routine is in some cases longer than what the human body can tolerate. Additionally, cultural differences can prevent women from going out in the public to work.<br><br>
                
            
            
One of the major problems for women in the developing world is underutilization of their skills. There are some entrepreneurs or skilled workers who do not have a market in which to perform, which leads to a huge loss for their community. Internationally, there are economic losses in every country stemming from gender gap in labor participation. There is furthermore less developed business infrastructure which female entrepreneurs especially are excluded from. This leads to dependency of inefficient or corrupt environments.
Our team at ComShare believes it would be beneficial if these women had their own market where they could make use of their potential.   </p>
