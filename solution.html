                <p id="textbox" tabindex="0">We have developed an app called COMSHARE. It stands for "Community Share". The idea is that the app will create a network for women, where work and inclusion are the basis. In many countries, women do not work, and their abilities remain an unused resource for society. They may work in low-paid jobs in factories where they do not have any rights at work. Through COMSHARE we want these resources women provide to reach society.</p>

                <p tabindex="0">The app should act as a platform where women can post different services they can offer. It can be all work. For example, a midwife explaining that she can come home to pregnant women. This may be in countries where women risk being abused at the hospitals or there is little availability of educated midwives. Another example may be women who are educated in technology but who do not have to go out and work. Then they have the opportunity to undertake assignments via the COMSHARE app.<br> 
Women in many parts of the world do women have phenomenal practical crafting abilities. The products they have created are not being used by many people. With ComShare, consumers locally and all over the world have the opportunity and the chance to buy these great crafted goods. These products will also be cheaper because they will not cost as much as what the mega companies charge. With the mega companies out of the pictures, 100% of the payment for a product will go to the people who have created a product. Furthermore, they will have better working conditions because they can choose to work from where they feel comfortable. The main idea is that women should have the opportunity to contribute with what they can.

            <h3>COMSHRE in developing countries</h3>

                    In many countries, the app will limit itself to those who can afford to own a phone. Here, of course, it will be problematic for the women to use the COMSHARE app. The solution for these countries is on a slightly larger scale. Here we want to reach companies that can take in women primarily as employees. Then, the supervisor of the company will use the app to sell the products that the women has crafted. These women could still choose to work from home but have to give their products to that the supervisor so that they can send them to the consumers and most of the money generated will go to the creators. There will be requirements for companies that cooperate with COMSHARE. One of the requirements will be that the companies are riven locally and not by the mega countries that exist.</p>

            <h3>Why COMSHARE?</h3>
            <p tabindex="0">
            
                One would like to think that “COMSHARE” will be an app similar to eBay , and other sales sites. Here will people already be able to post goods and sell them around the world. Many would like to produce goods themselves and sell them on eBay with higher profits? Even though COMSHARE will not act as a nonprofit company, COMSHARE will not be motivated to earn money. The foundation will be to empower women and give them the opportunity to contribute as an important resource to their community. The hope is to create more self-esteem among women, and by this to create further basis for gender equality. The women who use COMSHARE will not receive any kind of charity. They earn money on the work they themselves perform. This is something that is important to us, as we want them to see what resources they possess so they can feel guilty about their own lives. </p>
